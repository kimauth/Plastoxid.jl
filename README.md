# Plastoxid
`Plastoxid` is a finite element framework for multiphysics simulations. The package is
developed for the research project _"Computational modeling of crystal plasticity and
intergranular decohesion coupled to stress-assisted oxidation in high-temperature
polycrystalline alloys"_ at Chalmers University of Technology, funded under VR grant number 2018-04318 . If you use `Plastoxid`, please cite https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2022.104880 .

The package is based on the finite element toolbox [`Ferrite.jl`](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl), common material models 
are developed in [`MaterialModels.jl`](https://github.com/kimauth/MaterialModels.jl). [`Tensors.jl`](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Tensors.jl) is used for tensor calculus.
